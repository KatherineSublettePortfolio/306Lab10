Computer Science Learning Goals: 
	To develop effective problem solving skills. Again, what can I say. Itâ€™s basically the primary lesson this class has to teach.  
College Wide Learning Goals:
	Critical thinking. In my opinion critical thinking and creativity go hand in hand. There would be no way to solves these problems without critical thinking.
